# AWS-Threat_Detection_Management
The project sets up a real-time threat detection system in AWS using GuardDuty, which monitors AWS activity for threats. Alerts are sent via Amazon SNS, and automated remediation actions like blocking malicious IPs and isolating compromised instances are triggered using AWS Lambda and Systems Manager.
